# The cool particle engine that became a game, somehow.

Hi there!
This is some demo of a cool particle engine I made in 24 hours to help a student.
For now, this is basically the dirtiest code, I will clean it later, I swear!
I plan on pushing it a bit further by implementing some networking for a cool little game.

Feel free to use and adapt this code for your projects!

Currently, you get a cool game called "particle invaders".
The goal is to defend your little white triangle from the black mist by shooting at them (spacebar) and moving around (arrows/q-d).

The next objectives are:
- Implement sockets to play in coop (see network branch)
- Create some battle royale game using the same triangle, in a 2d map (or isometric)
- Add more little games, and pack all of them here
- Make the particle engine more versatile, so I don't have to copypaste anything ever again


If you want to run and test this project, you'll need :
- GNU Make
- CSFML
- GCC

Simply type make and then execute "particle"


Enjoy :)
